# Introduction to Programming in Python
`周百祥(Chou, Pai-Hsiang)` `2021 Fall` `CS 135800`

This course introduces fundamental programming concepts in the Python language and related environment.
Fundamental concepts include overview of computer systems, Python environment setup, Python language overview, 
command line interface, numbers, string formatting, sequences, dictionaries and sets, control flow, 
exception, file, function, recursion, object orientation, inheritance, polymorphism, and modules.
The programming environment will be primarily text-based in Unix environment, 
although graphical user interface (`IDLE`) and web-based (`Jupyter`) will also be demonstrated.
